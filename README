This project implements Stocastic Gradient Descent based Linear Regression, Closed Form solution for Linear Regression for the Learning To Rank Dataset and a synthetic Dataset
Configuration in main.py was found to provide best performance for a reasonable training time
I would suggest just refering the main.py as the code in the other files is the same, I just used the files to test different hyper parameters
I have uploaded the project description file(main.pdf) along with this, it would help in understanding some of the functions used here.
